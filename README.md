# Flapy Bird with IA
---

Lets train a IA to play flappy bird, but with GML üòê

This project is a flappy bird simulation to train a IA. Is done in Game Maker Studio 2, with GML.
I don't know if the sprites are copyrighted or not and they are binary, so I didn't commit them. I'll decide what to do with then lather, maybe just a link, or a drive.

IA works great at v2.0, but with a few caveats:
- Tubes are deleted after crossing birds position.
- IAs have control much control them us about there movement, they can fly in a contant position and instantly stop flying.
    - This is easy to fix, but will be done later.

This projects also is an exercise for me, so there is somethings more features than just the IA, as:
- score
- medals
- mode for humans 

But, **this is not the end point of this project**. So ignore bugs or bad implementation.
